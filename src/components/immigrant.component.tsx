            <p className="border-b-4">Every person who lives in or visits New Jersey has rights regardless of their citizenship or immigration status.
                The information and resources provided below are designed to help you understand those rights and responsibilities when interacting with immigration enforcement officers.<br/><br/>
                </p>
            <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-dark-main tracking-wider">If you encounter an immigration agent or other law enforcement in a public space:</h2>
            <ul className="text-start">
                <li>-You may ask to see their badge / identification. If you are unsure if the officer is an immigration agent, you may ask what agency they represent and specifically if they are federal immigration agents.</li>
                <li>-You may ask whether you are free to leave.</li>
                <li>-You have the right to remain silent and you are not required to answer questions. You may tell the immigration agent that you choose to remain silent.</li>
                <li>-If you are not a U.S. citizen and an immigration agent requests your immigration papers, you must show them if you have them with you. If you do not have documentation at the time of the encounter, you may tell the agent that you want to remain silent or that you want to consult a lawyer before answering questions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-2xl text-dark-main">Important Document Guidelines:</h3>
            <ul className="text-start">
                <li>-Carry valid U.S. government identification with you at all times.</li>
                <li>-If you have immigration documentation, carry your valid immigration papers, including your employment authorization card, and copies of your I-94s and Notices to Appear with you at all times.</li>
                <li>-Foreign documents should be left at home secured at all times.</li>
                <li>-Do not carry false or fraudulent documents, and never provide false or fraudulent documents to a police officer or immigration agent.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 className="text-2xl text-dark-main">Search Rights:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>If an immigration agent asks if they can search you, <strong>you have the right to say no</strong>. Agents generally do not have the right to search you or your belongings without your consent, a valid warrant, or probable cause.</li>
                <li>However, if an officer or agent searches you anyway, do not resist. You may tell them: <strong>“I do not consent to a search. I wish to remain silent. I wish to speak with an attorney as soon as possible.”</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>You may ask for an interpreter if they do not speak your language.</strong></p>
